## Overview

Autonomous AI systems sound appealing, but full autonomy is rarely the goal. What we need are systems smart enough to handle complexity independently, yet transparent enough for humans to guide, validate, and refine.

This requires sophisticated context engineering:

- **Memory management** that preserves context across interactions
- **State tracking** that maintains consistency over time
- **Multimodal processing** of text, images, data, and documents
- **Strategic HITL points** where human input adds maximum value

Rather than treating humans as fallbacks for AI failures, we design systems where human judgment elevates AI capabilities. The AI does the heavy lifting; humans provide nuance, domain expertise, and ethical oversight at precisely the right moments.
