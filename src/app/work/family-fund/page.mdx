## Overview

Traditional Design Thinking focuses on user needs and rapid prototyping, but often treats technology as a black box that can be "figured out later." This approach breaks down when building complex AI systems where technical architecture fundamentally shapes what's possible.

Systems Thinking goes deeper by integrating architectural thinking from day one. We consider:

- Core technology choices and their cascading implications
- Infrastructure patterns that enable scalability and resilience
- Data flow architectures that support AI model requirements
- Integration patterns across the entire technical ecosystem

This holistic approach ensures that design decisions and technical decisions inform each other, creating systems that are both elegant and technically sound.
