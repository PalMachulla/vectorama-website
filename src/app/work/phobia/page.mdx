## Overview

The future of AI is not monolithic models but ecosystems of specialized agents working together. Just as neurons form networks to create intelligence, AI agents form graphs that exhibit emergent properties beyond what any single agent could achieve.

We embrace graph thinking by structuring agentic systems as:

- **DAG architectures** where tasks flow through networks of specialized agents
- **Hive mind coordination** where agents share context and learn collectively
- **Parallel execution paths** that maximize efficiency and resilience
- **Dynamic routing** where work flows to the most capable agent

This approach treats the agentic space as a topology rather than a pipeline, enabling systems that are more flexible, scalable, and intelligent than traditional linear workflows.
